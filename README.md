## What it is

An very basic Order Management desktop app. Add, View, Update, and Delete Orders with persistent data. Built with:

- Python 🐍 
- SQLite and SQLiteStudio 💭
- Python tKinter 🎨 

## :electric_plug: What it does

**Create** , **View**, **Update**, and **Delete** Order Entries in a simple, straight to the point GUI. 

To Update an entry, simply select it from the list, make edits in the form, and hit the `Update Order` button.

 ### How to use
Two ways to use this: 

1️⃣ Simply download the `order_manager.exe` file from the `dist` folder on your Windows Desktop and start using it right away 
### or

2️⃣ if you're feeling geeky you can clone this repo, run 
```python
pip install # to install dependencies in Pipfile
``` 
and make edits to the `.py` files to suit your needs. 
While editing, you can run the 
```python
python order_manager.py # or whatever you rename the file to
```
to preview the app while in development. Then run 
```
pyinstaller order_manager.py --onefile --windowed
```
to compile to a single `.exe` file that can run on windows.

You can also mess around with the database in **SQLiteStudio** if you wish. Simply Add the `store.db` file (Generated on first use of the app) and have at it.

## 💡Learning Points

- Python Functions
- Basic SQL queries in python and SQLiteStudio
- Basic tkinter GUI design

## Some cool stuff

I'll write about this later... just feeling a bit lazy rn 😴 ...

```python
# Some Cool python code will be here... It's just classes mostly 
```
## Features in Development
Some Ideas in my head => 
* 🙎 User Authentication
* 📃 Additional form fields (like quantity or email)
* 🌐 Remote API server for syncing data accross multiple devices
* 🖨 Export Data to `.pdf`, `.xls` or `csv` files with ReportLab
